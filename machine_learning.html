        <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit programming. In this project, we explore supervised learning, a core aspect of ML, to train a teachable machine that classifies medical supplies like masks, thermometers, and medicines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The video below provides a practical introduction to Teachable Machines. This foundational knowledge supports the development of our Medical Supplies Classifier.
