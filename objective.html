        <h1>Medical Supplies Classifier</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Our goal is to develop a simple yet effective AI classifier to identify common medical supplies, such as masks, thermometers, and medicines. This project seeks to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in everyday life while promoting awareness and education about medical tools that are crucial in healthcare and emergency scenarios.
        </p>
        <h2>Significance of the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Medical Supplies Classifier is a step towards utilizing artificial intelligence for the benefit of public health. As machine learning technology advances, we envision expanding this project to a variety of real-world application scenarios, such as
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Streamlining the classification of medical supplies during a pandemic: In critical situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, efficiently classifying and identifying medical supplies can save time and ensure that essential items get to the people who need them. This classifier can help automate the sorting process, reducing labor and errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Educational tool: Sorters can also be used as a learning aid for students and the general public to familiarize them with the names and appearance of basic medical tools, thus increasing their awareness of what to do in an emergency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced Supply Chain Management: For the healthcare supply chain, classifiers can identify items on a proportional basis, ensuring proper inventory tracking and scheduling, especially during periods of high demand.
