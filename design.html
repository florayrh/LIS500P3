        <p>
            Our project focuses on developing a teachable machine capable of image recognition. The machine is trained using images of masks, thermometers, and medicines, employing supervised learning models and neutral category recognition for classification. The training images for the teachable machine were carefully selected, representing most types of these three categories to enhance recognition capabilities. By creating this system, our goal is not only to complete technical tasks but also to leverage technology to enhance public awareness of medical items, making the project more meaningful in real-world applications.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>1. Category Selection and Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            We selected three categories—masks, thermometers, and medicines—for training our model. Each category has 87 photos to ensure fairness. To ensure diversity and inclusivity, we collected training images from various sources. Firstly from internet. We chose images representing objects from different regions worldwide, capturing variations in design, color, and shape. 
            Additionally, we used a mix of webcam-recorded images and curated samples to ensure the training data included multiple angles and lighting conditions. 
            This robust dataset was essential for enhancing the model's recognition capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to mention that, as for medicines category, we only take into consideration pills and pill packages without including liquid or cream medicines since pills are the most common in our daily life for adults.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>2. Preprocessing and Training</h3>
        <p>
            The training process includes image screening and format unification. In the process of training, we performed several iterative training to improve the ability of the model to accurately distinguish categories. This iterative process involves analyzing the image content that has been provided to the model and the accuracy using current photos.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Model Testing and Deployment</h3>
        <p>
            After training, the model underwent several testing using a separate dataset to evaluate its accuracy and reliability. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the website, users can upload images or use their webcam to test the model, allowing them to experience the application firsthand.
